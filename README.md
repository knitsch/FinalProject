3 Dimensional Vector Field Gui

This is a gui that takes in 3 functions of x,y,z for the i j and k components of a vector field,
and it plots the 3 dimensional vector field accordingly. Enter the functions in proper matlab
syntax, making sure to type 3*x or x*y instead of 3x or xy. Use the plot button to plot the current 
functions as a vector field. Use the clear button to clear the vector field plot. Use the slider to
adjust the zoom level, from the default 1x zoom to a maximum 5x zoom.
